# Discord for VT Clubs

Are you a part of student club leadership at Virginia Tech? Looking for a messaging platform that works for clubs big and small? Discord offers means of both mass and personal communication: channels to separate conversations based on topics, roles to separate your officers from regular members, and multiple ways to share your server with new members.

Welcome to the "Discord for VT Clubs" user guide. This guide will outline how to use Discord for your VT club from creating an account to setting up special roles for your club officers.

Discord offers a large variety of features, not all of which will be covered in this guide. This guide takes a streamlined approach, cutting out all of the unnecessary noise of current discord documentation. Instead, it focuses only on the essentials of club communication. 

>[!Note]
>Although you can use the mobile app to set up your server, this guide focuses on how to setup a server using the desktop application.

## Intro to Discord
### Getting Started
This section will show you how to download Discord and create an account. Discord can be used on the website, but it is recommended that you use the app to have access to more features. 

#### On PC
To create an account using your desktop, go to the [Discord website](https://discord.com/) and scroll down to where it says **Download for [name of your operating system]** (i.e "Download for Windows"). Follow the download directions.

#### On Mobile
To create an account using your phone, go to the App Store or Google Play and search for "Discord". Hit the **download** button. Once downloaded, hit the **Open** button, this will open the app on your phone.

### Creating an Account
If you are not logged in already, you will need to log in or create an account. To start this, click the **Register** button. You'll be prompted to enter an email, display name, username, password, and birth date.

An email will be sent to the account you used for registration. Click the **Claim Account** button. This will claim your account. After claiming your account, a 5 digit number will appear after your username. This is a unique number used to differentiate your account from others.

## Discord Anatomy
This section defines various Discord terms that will be referred to throughout this document. Below are images breaking down your view of Discord on PC.

![Servers are listed vertically all the way to the left of the screen, and Chats/DMs are listed vertically just to the right of servers](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1fWxedk-g.png)

#### Chat/Direct Message
A way to communicate with members 1:1 or in a small group. Chats are generally more private (you're not sending messages to potentially hundreds of people). Displayed below is a chat to a single user:
![A heading with "Direct Messages" on the left with a "+" on the right. Below the heading a rectangle is displayed with the profile picture and name of a Discord user.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJwYjBWyZg.png)

You can access direct messages by clicking on the button with the discord logo in the upper-left corner of the screen.

![A blue square with rounded edges with the white discord logo is in the upper left corner of the screen. Right of it is "Find or start a conversation," and directly below is the server list.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJjJ9S-kbg.png)



#### Profile
This is your Discord account. You use it to join servers and DM others. Your profile is also customizable. Find more information on customizing a profile on [this Discord page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403147417623-Custom-Profiles).


#### Server
The subject of this guide! Made of multiple channels. Much more feature-rich than text chats. May have moderators, roles, and apps. You can find a list of their icons on the left side of your screen.
![A Discord server icon. Appears as a blue square with rounded edges and the white text: "D!".](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By0sDBb1-e.png)

Below is an image of the server itself and a breakdown of the main features.

![Channels are located towards the left, server name is towards the top and messages are located towards the center.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1I8MlOJbx.png)


#### Channel
Similar to a chat, but exists inside a server so that you, and all of your members, can communicate with each other. There are 2 types of channels that are most commonly used in club servers on Discord: **Voice** and **Text**. 

* **Voice :** Allows you to connect with other members by having live voice (and video) conversations with up to 99 members. Voice channels don't require you to start a call, you just click on the channel to join it. Additionally, members can choose to have their microphone and camera enabled or disabled for privacy.
![Voice channels are denoted by a speaker icon on the left of the channel name.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyAstSb1We.png)


* **Text :** Allows you to connect with other members by texting them. Text channels are like group chats, but you can specifically mention people by using the **@** key, followed by the person's username. 
![Text channels are denoted by a "#" to the left of the channel name.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkRIFSWyWx.png)




    You can also create different channels on Discord (more on this later...) to keep conversations more organized or only allow certain members, such as club leaders, to send messages in a channel.

#### Roles
A way to organize members and grant permissions. Discord's system for roles uses colors (ex: red = the lowest group, purple = administrator, etc). Users with multiple roles will only display the color of their highest role. You can also manage roles (this will be discussed later on in the document).
 
 >[!Note]
The administrator role has the highest number of permissions. Make sure you assign this role appropriately!



#### Creating a server
1. Navigate to [Discord](https://discord.com/)
2. Select **Create a server**
3. Select **Club or Community** (this allows for very large groups as your club grows)
4. Add your public name and picture (such as a club logo!)
5. Create your server!

## Channels
**Common Channels for Clubs**

## Roles and Permissions
Your members will have different club roles such as:

    * ex: active/unactive member or members with paid/unpaid dues

### How to Make Roles

2. Select **Server Settings**
3. Navigate to the **Roles** tab and select **Create Role**.
4. Under **Role Name**, write an appropriate name for this role. This will be displayed to all discord users. 
**(Optional)** Under **Role Color** select a color for this role. Users's names that have this particular role will be displayed in this color.
5. Save changes to confirm your selection.

### Server Permissions

Discord follows a top-down structure for permissions. This means that members can only affect users with roles lower than their highest role. Base permissions are already given to all members automatically, but this doesn't account for role specific permissions. The following section will describe the most useful permission types to give to club officers, or other higher up roles, and then break down how to apply them.

**I. Administrator Permission**
Administrator is the most powerful role as it grants all permissions to the assigned role. This permission should be used with caution. This position is recommended for the club leader, or the club officer responsible for running the discord.

**II. Manage Roles**
Users with this permission can create and modify roles positioned below their own. They cannot assign any permissions to individuals at their own level or higher, nor assign any permissions that they themselves have not been granted. This role is recommended for club officers.

**III. Manage Messages**
The role with this permission can delete messages sent by other members or pin any message. This permission is recommended for club officers, or other members responsible for moderating the server. 

**IV. Manage Expressions**
Users with this permission may edit or remove custom emoji, stickers and sounds in this server. This permission is recommended for club officers, or other members responsible for moderating the server. 

**V. Kick, Approve, and Reject Members**
Users with this permission can kick other members from this server. Kicked members may rejoin the server if they have another invite. If the server enables Member Requirements, this role can also approve or reject members from joining the server.

**VI. Ban Members**
Allows the role with this permission to permanently ban other members and delete their message history.

**Other Permissions**
There are many more discord permissions built into the application. If you have a specific permission you wish to grant, consult the [Permissions on Discord](https://discord.com/community/permissions-on-discord-discord) webpage.

### Assigning Permissions

1. **Right click** on the server name.
2. Scroll down to the **Server Settings** option and hover over it. 
3. Scroll over and down to the **Roles** option in the new bar next to Server Settings.
![Roles should be located under Members and above Invites](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJxYCeBb1bx.png)
4. Locate the role you want to administer permissions for and select the **edit** icon located to the right of this role's name.
![The edit icon appears as a pencil](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1cKWSZJWe.png)
5. Click the **permissions** tab (located at the top of the edit role menu)
6. Scroll through this menu and find the desired permission 
    >[!Note] 
    >If you are having trouble locating your desired permission, you can also type the name of said permission into the search bar at the top of the screen to locate it faster
7. **Toggle the button** to the right of this permission and it should turn green to signal that it has been enabled
8. Press **Save Changes** to confirm your selection 


## Sharing the Server
Now that you have a working server, you'll want to get your club members in! There are two methods to get club members in your server: invite links, and QR codes.

### On PC
#### Evergreen Invite Link
This is where we will teach you how to create a permanent invite link to easily share your server with others. 

1. Click on the name of your **discord server**. You should see these list of options:
![Dropdown list when arrow's clicked.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryuk0DSCeg.png)
2. Click on the **Invite People** option. If you have been using Discord before, you'll see a list of friends on Discord as well as any group chats you're in. **Invite People** is the 2nd option in the dropdown
3. There will also be a "Or, send a server invite link to a friend". It looks like this:
![A text box with the title "Or, send a server invite link to a friend." The text in the box is a discord link, with a "Copy" button on its right side.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJEukuHRxe.png)
4. Click the **copy button** to copy the invite link. You can now paste the link and send it off.

## Moderation
### Virginia Tech
Any club communication is an extension of the club. Even online, your club leadership and members are subject to the [Virginia Tech Principles of Community](https://www.vt.edu/principles-of-community.html) as well as the [Virginia Tech Honor Code](https://www.registrar.vt.edu/content/dam/registrar_vt_edu/documents/governance/2015-2016/HONOR-CODE-MANUAL-10-9-15.pdf). It's important to make students aware of this, for example with a message in a dedicated #rules channel. The tone of the club might be casual, but it's a bad idea to risk your server becoming known as a den of--gasp!--*academic dishonestly.* If it's easy to join your server, your club members should be reminded that it's easy for people to join the club and read what they're saying.

### Discord
Your club will also be subject to the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). Familiarize your club officers with these, here are the most important restrictions:
* Don’t use the services to do harm to yourself or others.
* Don’t use the services to do harm to Discord. 
* Don’t use the services to do anything else that’s illegal.

### Your VT CLub
Before using Discord for club communication, talk over the rules and regulations of Discord, the university, and your club. Decide on boundaries, disciplinary actions, and who is responsible for executing these.
If club leadership decides that a member should no longer be in the Discord server, see this [Discord guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360055478831-Move-Members-and-Disconnect) on how to remove members from a server. 


## Other Features
### App directory
Discord is itself an "Application" or "App" on your device. Additionally, Discord offers an *app directory*, with a variety of games and features. These are detailed in this [Guide to Discord Apps](https://discord.com/blog/how-to-use-discord-apps).

### Threads
Threads allow users to continue conversations on a particular topic without getting mixed around in a big chat. This is particularly useful for scheduling meetings or arranging carpools. Here's a useful [guide to threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ).
### Nitro & Server Boosting
Nitro is Discord's subscription service. A $10/month subscription grants two server boosts, which can be used on your club server to gain various benefits! These include higher-quality streams making online movie nights more feasible and custom emojis to build club identity. You can consult [this FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ) for more information on boosts.
### More Permissions 
Discord contains a multitude of permissions for every purpose. This document covers the most pertinent permissions to club leaders. However, if you wish to learn more about permissions refer to [Permissions on Discord](https://discord.com/community/permissions-on-discord-discord).

## Troubleshooting
Our guide is streamlined and doesn't include everything. If you run into any technical problems, refer to [Discord's support site](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/categories/200404378).
